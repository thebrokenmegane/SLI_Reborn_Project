Handcrafted profiles containing SLI bit values for various DX11 games.

# About this profiles
From 2018 to 2020, I have been working on a personal project to expand support for Scalable Link Interface (SLI), a multi-GPU technology from NVIDIA. As a result of my efforts, I have been able to support a wide variety of game software, but some of them have a lot of bugs and graphics corruption that I can't do anything about.
I have been keeping these profiles locally and have never released them to the public, but I decided to release them on Github for the following reasons.

Reason #1: I had to let go of one of my two GPUs (GTX1080).
Reason #2: No time to spare.

Using SLI with high performance GPUs can cause fires and damage due to heat, and data corruption due to bugs in the game. Therefore, please use this profile at your own risk.
