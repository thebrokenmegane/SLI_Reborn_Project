# SLI_Reborn_Project
Handcrafted profiles containing SLI bit values for various DX11, DX12 games.

# About this profiles
From 2018 to 2020, I have been working on a personal project to expand support for Scalable Link Interface (SLI), a multi-GPU technology from NVIDIA. As a result of my efforts, I have been able to support a wide variety of game software, but some of them have a lot of bugs and graphics corruption that I can't do anything about.
I have been keeping these profiles locally and have never released them to the public, but I decided to release them on Github for the following reasons.

Reason #1: I had to let go of one of my two GPUs (GTX1080).
Reason #2: No time to spare.

Using SLI with high performance GPUs can cause fires and damage due to heat, and data corruption due to bugs in the game. Therefore, please use this profile at your own risk.


# Supported game titles
Anthem (Electronic Arts)
Assetto Corsa Competizione (Kunos Simulazioni)  // Compatible with SLI but no performance gain.
Code Vein (Bandai Namco)  // Compatible with SLI but no performance gain.
Facerig (Holotech Studios)
Forza Horizon 4 (MIcrosoft Studio)  // Terrible graphic bugs. Amazingly, SLI worked on DX12.
Forza Mortorsport 7 (MIcrosoft Studio)  // Minor graphic bugs. Amazingly, SLI worked on DX12.
Genshin Impact (mihoyo)  // Not tested. It may works because I gave the same bits as little witch nobeta.
KurtzPel (KOG Studios)  // A little FPS increased I think.
Little Witch Nobeta (Pupuya Games) // Works fine but FPS can drop drastically depending on the direction of the camera. Caution: I don't own paid copy of this game. So I used demo version and registerd demo .exe in this profile. So please add proper .exe manually in Nvidia Profile Inspector! 
Mosnter Hunter World (Capcom) // Works fine but you may face a little graphic issue about TAA.
Need for Speed Payback (Electronic Arts)
Phantasy Star Online 2 (SEGA) // Not tested on DX11 version.
The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition (Bethesda) // Works fine with no graphic issues.
Totally Accurate Battle Simulator (Landfall)
V-Katsu (IVR) // Just buggy on my pc.
VRChat (VRChat inc.) // Not tested because I don't own any VR devices. But I gave some SLI bits.

# About support
Due to the global outbreak of coronavirus, I had to give up one of my GPUs due to financial problems. Therefore, unless I get a pair of GPUs of the same type, I will not be able to test or support you. Therefore, I would be happy if you could improve this profile.
I will try to answer your problems and questions as best I can, but will not be quick to respond. I have a lot of work to do, and I rarely have access to a PC. But I will try to help as much as I can.

# Special thanks
Orbmu2k -- Thanks to you, I was able to create this profile. Thank you very much.
